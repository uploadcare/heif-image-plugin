A HEIF/HEIC and AVIF plugin for [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)
based on the [pyheif](https://github.com/carsales/pyheif) library.

Originally based on the [pyheif-pillow-opener](https://github.com/ciotto/pyheif-pillow-opener)
code from Christian Bianciotto.

## Installation

You can install **heif-image-plugin** from *PyPI*:

`pip install heif-image-plugin`

### Install libheif binaries for saving capabilities

Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
apt-get install --no-install-recommends \
    libheif-examples \
    libheif-plugin-libde265 \
    libheif-plugin-x265 \
    libheif-plugin-aomenc
```

Minimal supported libheif version is 1.17.x.

## How to use

Just import once before opening an image.

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
import HeifImagePlugin

image = Image.open('test.heic')
ImageOps.exif_transpose(image, in_place=True)
# requires `heif-enc` binary with installed codecs or plugins
image.save('test.avif')
```

Encoder-specific parameters can be passed when saving:

```python
image.save(
    'test.avif',
    quality=90,
    subsampling='420',
    downsampling='average',
    encoder='aom',
    concurrency=4,
    encoder_params={'speed': 6},
)
```

## How to contribute

Contributions are welcome:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/uploadcare/heif-image-plugin.git`.
2. Build the development image: `make docker_build`.
3. Start a development shell: `make docker_shell`.
4. Make your changes and add tests.
5. Run `make lint` and `make test` inside the container.
6. Commit your changes on a new branch and open a pull request.


## Changelog

### 0.8.0

* Minimal supported Python version is 3.9
* Minimal supported libheif version is 1.17.x
* Added `encoder_params` parameter for passing custom encoder parameters when saving
* Changed the default chroma downsampling algorithm from `nn` to `average`
* Default chroma subsampling is now explicitly set to 4:2:0

### 0.7.0

* Depends on pyheif>=0.8.0; dropped support for older versions

### 0.6.2

* Fix for buggy LA mode in libheif 1.17.0 - 1.18.2
* Fixed unsupported color conversion for some images

### 0.6.1

* Added compatibility with Pillow 10.1+

### 0.6.0

* Minimal supported pyheif is 0.7.1
* Added `downsampling` parameter for saving. Works only with `subsampling` == 2.
* Transformations support updated to the latest libheif and pyheif

### 0.5.1

* Fixed HEIF saving in '1' mode

### 0.5.0

* Added HEIF saving support if `heif-enc` is installed (part of libheif)
* Fixed `HeifImageFile.verify()` call
* Extensions `.heic`, `.avif`, `.heif`, `.hif` are handled by the plugin

### 0.4.0

* Bypass some decoding errors when `ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES` is True.

### 0.3.2

* Depends on latest pyheif.

### 0.3.1

! This version requires pyheif with `pyheif.open` API. As of 2021.11.25 this API
isn't released and is in pyheif's master. See `install-pyheif-master-pillow-latest`
target in the `Makefile` to install it.

* Fixed potential vulnerability with arbitrary data in exif metadata.

### 0.3.0

! This version requires pyheif with `pyheif.open` API. As of 2021.11.25 this API
isn't released and is in pyheif's master. See `install-pyheif-master-pillow-latest`
target in the `Makefile` to install it.

* `pyheif.open` API is used for lazy images loading.
* Fixed an error when the plugin tries to load any ISOBMFF files.
* AVIF files should work before, but now this is official.
* Patched versions of `pyheif` and `libheif` with exposed transformations are supported.
  In this case opened image isn't transformed on loading and orientation is stored
  in EXIF `Orientation` tag like for all other image formats.
  This is faster and consumes less memory.

### 0.2.0

* No need to register, works after import.
* Fill `info['icc_profile']` on loading.
* Close and release file pointer after loading.
* Decoding without custom HeifDecoder(ImageFile.PyDecoder).
